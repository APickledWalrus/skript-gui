skript-gui is built with [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper), meaning it inherits its license from that project.
Thus, skript-gui is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](GPL.txt).

However, to promote an open platform, I have chosen to release all of [my contributions](https://github.com/APickledWalrus/skript-gui/commits/master/?author=APickledWalrus) under the [MIT license](MIT.txt).
