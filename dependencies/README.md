####Dependencies

Since it uses some NMS/OBC codes, It is necessary to manually add the spigot jars here.

1_12_R1: `spigot-1.12-R0.1-SNAPSHOT`  
1_11_R1: `spigot-1.11-R0.1-SNAPSHOT`  
1_10_R1: `spigot-1.10-R0.1-SNAPSHOT`  
1_9_R2: `spigot-1.9.4-R0.1-SNAPSHOT`  
1_9_R1: `spigot-1.9.2-R0.1-SNAPSHOT`  
1_8_R3: `spigot-1.8.8-R0.1-SNAPSHOT`  
1_7_R4: `spigot-1.7.10-SNAPSHOT`

In this folder is included all jars for dependencies. Most of them are old plugins which isn't supported anymore, so I might remove it from TuSKe soon.
